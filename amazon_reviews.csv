Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,Love this coffee for Iced coffee. Very low acid great coffee,5,07/22/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,I preferred when they didn't sweeten the coffee. I can't stand sucralose and the flavor is very strong I wish the would go back to unsweetened flavored coffee. My mom liked them but she has used artificial sweetener for years. I gave them all to her and she took them to work. I won't buy unless it is unsweetened. The plain options are also to dark of a roast for me. But I used to buy and drink this everyday. It was great.,2,07/19/2025,Negative
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"I have had other competitor's brands, some good and others not so much. This was my first time trying Java House and I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was.

Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"Love these, especially for traveling!! Iâ€™ve gotten to prefer iced coffee and these are perfect to throw in my bag for a weekend trip. I mix it with a protein shake and itâ€™s a great breakfast!
Nice if Iâ€™m in a hurry for work, just fill my glass with ice and make it when I get to school. Good flavor and convenient! Saves me money, as I pass by the expensive coffee shops and make my own!",5,07/15/2025,Positive

Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"Hi
I have received the order yesterday and was exited to try it, but it came expired last year.
this is disappointing",1,06/11/2025,Negative
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,I do not care for the taste of these. The convenience and ease of preparation is nice but I will not be buying again.,1,,Negative
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"These are the most convenient and yummiest pods ever!! Cup, ice, pod, water, creamer, done! In less than one minute I have an iced coffee that rivals the taste of a coffee shop.",5,05/28/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods," I wasn't expecting to like this but the coffee flavor is excellent. Over ice with some nitro cream... delicious. I will definitely order this again.
",5,05/26/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"These liquid coffee pods are the most convenient thing ever made for a quick and easy coffee!
The concentrate mixes into my ice water and ice milk very easily unlike powders that need to be mixed into something hot.
It tastes pretty good as well but I do add additional syrup to my iced coffee when it's available for a nice sweet treat.

These are pricey so I'm not sure if I'd justify getting it again unless it's on sale.",5,04/14/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"we love making our own coffee drinks from scratch, but sometimes we need something quick on the way out the door. this is perfect for that. it's also great for making drinks on vacation. the pods are bigger than most other concentrates i've used. the coffee tastes fresh and the salted carmel is balanced out very well. i still add a little extra salted carmel flavor to mine, but it's good without adding extra.",5,04/03/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,Love them,5,03/17/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"Coffee has a weird coconut oil taste. Also, boxes were crushed during shipping. 4 pods in each box were damaged.",1,03/14/2025,Negative
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,Really good and easy,5,03/13/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"Delicious ðŸ˜‹. I had my mom try with me and even she said it tastes like the iced coffee we buy (I mixed mine with milk, I do plan to try with water sometime soon). Definitely a great thing to have on hand",4,03/08/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"I wanted Java House Cold Brew Coffee Salted Caramel flavor because I've had other products from this brand before that I generally have enjoyed.

Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed with this one. While it was easy to mix with water or milk I found it hard to get a good balance of flavor/sweetness. The first time I had it the salted caramel was very pronounced, but then another there was hardly any salted caramel flavor at all and just the taste of cheap coffee. I tried anywhere from 4-8oz of liquid and it was never consistent. It's not necessarily bad, but itâ€™s not quite what I had hoped for based on my previous experiences with the brand.",3,02/28/2025,Negative
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"This cold brew has a nice balance of smooth coffee flavor with just a touch of sweetness. The salted caramel adds a subtle richness without being too strong. Itâ€™s easy to use, whether you want it hot or iced, and the concentrate makes it convenient without any bitterness. A solid choice for a quick and flavorful coffee",4,02/18/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,Good stuff. Really super convenient and perfect for traveling and camping. Really enjoying these,5,02/17/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,Makes a decent on the go/quick need it now drink. Won't compete for a real machine made or pour over drink but that is not likely the market for this type of thing,4,02/13/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"I really enjoyed this both hot and cold. I generally drink hot coffee, so that is how I'll enjoy the remainder of the cups. This is really convenient, and it tastes really fresh. I found the flavor was best when I added some liquid creamer. I like Italian sweet creme flavor, which added enough sweetener along with the cream to negate the need for added sweetener. The addition of the cream gave it a thick, luxurious body, and the caramel flavor was spectacular. It is super convenient to have around. I think I would love it even more if I was more into iced coffee, because it can be added to a bottle of ice-cold water so easily.

Overall, this was a great drinking experience. At a little over a dollar a pod ($12.74 for a box of 12 as of review date), this is a much smarter option than the coffee place on the corner",5,02/12/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"I've been mixing this into hot water with just a touch of soy milk and it is DELICIOUS! The caramel is a nice flavor and it's not overly sweet. I couldn't love it more. If you like flavored coffees that aren't too sweet, you might like this! Really glad I gave this a try! I'll be back for more!",5,02/07/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"I was really excited for this Java House Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, but I think I overhyped it in my head. I found that I was wanting more sweetness, and the concentrate reminded me too much of a sad room temp coffee from that morning. However, when I handed it to my partner to try, he said it was great! Once I added sweetener to it, the caramel taste came out much more. When they say Lightly sweet, they aren't kidding!",4,02/04/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"This tastes good. It's like a k-cup, except you don't need a machine to make coffee... just some water to dilute it a little as it's concentrated. I guess you could just take it as a coffee shooter, but I wouldn't recommend it.
It's super convenient to have around if you drink coffee all day.
The flavor is good, and it provides the expected boost you get from coffee. Great value for what you get.",5,02/01/2025,Positive
Java House,Caramel Cold Brew Pods,"This is my first time trying a liquid concentrate coffee - I was hopeful this would be a good travel coffee for when I don't always have a coffee machine available, I could microwave some water in the lobby, haha. This was pretty simple to reconstitute with some boiling water. I found it dissolved easier and tasted the best straight with really really hot water. By itself it tastes.... ok as black coffee. A little cloyingly sweet. When I added plain milk to make it latte style it was MUCH better and less syrupy sweet. This will do in a pinch for me when travelling, but won't replace my regular coffee pods.",4,01/30/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,Love this coffee! Mornings never tasted so good!,5,07/29/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"Convenient and Delicious! This stuff is great!! Saves me so much time and money by making my own. Plus itâ€™s way healthier! So smooth, great caffeine content, great quality coffee flavor!",5,07/29/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,The concentrate adds so much flavor to my preexisting protein and makes it taste better than the $8 coffee I was getting every day! Also use their protein coffee and it is also delish!,5,07/28/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"Javvy is the best tasing coffee concentrate for the money that I have found. I have tried numerous other brands, but Javvy tastes the best. Simple and easy to use, I get a month's worth of coffee out of 4 bottles. I love all the different flavors too.
",5,07/28/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"Perfect for any occasion, but particularly for someone whoâ€™s dieting! I love this stuff with some protein milk! Plus just a little goes a LONG way!",5,07/28/2025,Positive

Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,Super easy and fast way to make my iced coffee at home before work. I like that I can make it my way to fit macros and it is super delicious. Bonus that is it cheaper than a coffee shop!,5,07/27/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"It's easy and good, Does save over a coffee house but have to have milk, flavoring, sauce etc. So if you like just regular coffee there is no savings over your regular morning plain coffee, I doubt I'd buy again",3,07/25/2025,Negative
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"I just tried my 1 out of 4 flavor and I canâ€™t wait to try the rest!!!! I had sugar cookie with instead of water or milk I added vanilla premiere protein (30mg) on ice!
So freaking good!",5,07/24/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"Iâ€™ve been using this coffee concentrate for a few weeks now, and itâ€™s a game changer. On busy mornings when Iâ€™m rushing out the door for work, itâ€™s incredibly quick and convenientâ€”just pour, add water or milk, and go. No mess, no waiting. The best part? It actually tastes good. Smooth, rich flavor without any bitterness. Highly recommend if you need a fast and tasty caffeine fix!",5,07/23/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,Excellent flavor with no bitterness after! A bit expensive dice but worth it when you consider the cost of purchasing at a coffee shop. Will be buying again and trying other flavors,5,07/23/2025,Positive

Easiest ice coffees! awesome in morning protein shakes! And yes, even made hot coffee with it! Worked fantastic on my camping trips too!
So glad I listened to my daughter!",5,07/18/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"We love javvy, cheap, quick and tasty",5,07/18/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"A little goes a long way, and it doesnâ€™t have a weird flavor. This makes adding caffeine to a chocolate protein shake or making an iced latte much faster in the morning and only 1tsp per serving means it lasts forever.",5,07/17/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,Easy to use and very convenient! I bought through the website cause I didn't realize Amazon had it. I add it to my protein shake and it's pretty good. A little goes a long way for me. I'm not a strong coffee drinker,5,07/16/2025,Positive

Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"I ordered directly through Javvy and of course you get automatically renewed for a membership. Is it good? Yes, itâ€™s decent. Does one bottle really equal 35 servings? Nope. Is it worth the $90 I got charged for 4 small bottles? NOPE.",1,07/16/2025,Negative
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,"I absolutely LOVE Javvy!!! Make Decaf iced coffee on these hot 107Â° summer days!! Keep a Caramel bottle at work for a quick coffee pickup. Even make them for Co-workers when we've had a rough
shift! Javvy is Fantastic",5,07/16/2025,Positive

Great flavor options and many to choose from. Perfect and quick option for coffee!",5,07/14/2025,Positive
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,I bought the caramel followed the instructions and I am disappointed. This is very bitter unsweetened and tastes nothing like caramel. I see no difference between this and run of the mill instant coffee. Save your money and buy plain coffee,2,07/14/2025,Negative
Javvy,Caramel Coffee Concentrate,I love the convenience of this concentrate and the large variety of flavors,5,07/14/2025,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"Every morning! and itâ€™s quickly become my favorite. The smooth, rich caramel flavor blends perfectly no bitterness, just creamy sweetness.",5,06/30/2025,Positive

Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"I love this concentrated coffee. It is delicious, and often on sale. Sometimes I have to wait for it to to come in stock.",5,03/15/2025,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,Really surprised at how good this is. Even if you wanted a hot cup of coffee this microwaved is miles better than a Keurig and just as quick. The concentrate let's you dilute it to strength and the logistics of selling it concentrated makes it much cheaper than other bottled cold brewed coffee.,5,06/03/2025,Positive

Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,Super delicious,5,07/12/2025,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,absolutely disgusting. Itâ€™s tasted nothing like Starbucks and was a waste of money.,1,07/24/2025,Negative
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"While the coffee itself is good, itâ€™s not strong enough to be considered a concentrate. I purchased three separate flavors (caramel, signature black, and the limited edition brown sugar cinnamon), but none of them required any amount of water to be added to level out the flavor like coffee concentrate is supposed to. Of the three flavors I purchased, I enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon the least because it was far too sweet for my preferences, and I had to add the signature black to make it drinkable. I do want to note that I prefer stronger coffee, so if you enjoy a lighter flavor this could still be good for you, but for those who enjoy a nice strong concentrate to easily adjust the strength of our day to day cup, Iâ€™d recommend looking elsewhere",4,04/18/2025,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"For me, this was a decent purchase and will buy again. Package indicates 5 drinks can be made, I was able to make 6.

I had it two ways:

1) Mixed 50:50 coffee-water ratio over ice with no sweetener added. You definitely get the aroma of caramel, and a nice over all coffee drink.

2) Mixed 60:40 coffee-milk with sugar added. Made for a great sweet treat.",4,11/10/24,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,Nice way to add flavor to a protein shake,5,04/09/2025,Positive
Starbucks,Caramel Dolce Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"The coffee taste is OK, but it takes a lot of coffee for a cup of water. Seems like itâ€™s watered down.",3,03/30/2025,Negative
